# LSTM_CNN_Russell_CIFAR10

The above codes perform:

1. LSTM for Generative Model for Texts performed on Bertrand Russell's writing styles
2. CNN and Deep CNN on CIFAR 10

This was done as part of course DSCI 552, under Prof. Rajati, in Fall 2020, at USC

Coding was done around the same time but the upload was done later in Spring 2021, re-organized into a public repository
